# Student-Dairy-OOPS-proejct
Users of Student Dairy are faculty of University to keep track of students academic details  
The following are the required files to run my java Project.
My project can be tested by running StudentDiary class.
Initially, we can enter all the student detais, techfest details and culturalfest details which are held in University. At any point of time we can change the details of students, techfest and cultualfests if required.
I wrote a class for each course in order to change marks distribution for any course(may be periodical marks, internal marks distribution and endsem marks distribution).
Mean while we can choose between attendence and marks options so that we can update or view attendence or we can update and view marks of any student.
We can add or remove studnet whenever we want which does not create any issues for the project.
(**Student roll no should start from 1 while inputing).
UI is not yet developed.
